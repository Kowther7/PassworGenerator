# Random Password Generator App 
 
 This week's challenge was to work on a random password generator, where we were provided with the source code. The task was to prompt the user to choose a password length ranging from 8 to 128 characters. Additionally, the user was required to select a combination of symbols, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters for the password generation. It was an exciting project aimed at enhancing the security and strength of passwords for various applications.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
